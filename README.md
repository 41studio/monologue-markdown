# Monologue: markdown

This is a simple extension that will change Monologue's default editor to EpicEditor which will let you use Markdown instead of a WYSIWYG edit.

## Install on a brand new Monologue installation

This is simple, you just have to add this file to your Gemfile after Monologue:

    gem "monologue-markdown", :git => "git@github.com:jipiboily/monologue-markdown.git"

## Install on an already existing Monologue installation

Not advised to do so for now, see the TODOs.

## TODO

* upgrade tool?
